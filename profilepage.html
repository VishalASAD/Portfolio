                    <h3>Project 1: Autism Prediction System</h3>
                    <p>This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict autism spectrum disorders (ASD) by analyzing behavioral scores. By examining various metrics such as communication skills, social interactions, and repetitive behaviors, the model aims to assist in early diagnosis and intervention, providing valuable insights for clinicians and researchers to identify potential signs of autism more effectively.</p>

                    <h3>Project 3: Forest Fire Detection System</h3>
                    <p>The Forest Fire Detection System leverages IoT technology to monitor and detect early signs of forest fires. The system uses sensors to collect real-time data on environmental factors like temperature, humidity, and smoke levels. This data is transmitted to a central system where it is analyzed to detect potential fire hazards, allowing for timely alerts and intervention.</p>
